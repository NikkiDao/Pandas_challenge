Observable Trends Based on Data:
1.	Comparing the 5 top performing schools with 5 bottom performing schools, we can see that the 5 schools with best percentage overall passing are all Charter type school, while the bottom performing schools are district type. Based on the summary below, we can also see that:
-	Total students of District type schools are significantly higher than Charter type schools
-	Total budget of District type schools are significantly higher than Charter type schools
With District type schools ranked bottom performing, we can conclude that with higher amount of budget per student, it does not help students to perform better in math and reading tests or both. 
Ranking	School Type	Total Students
of 5 schools	Total Budget of 5 schools	Avg %Overall Passing of 5 schools	Per Student Budget
Top 5	Charter	8,206	$4,947,418	%90.79	$602.90
Bottom 5	District	19,261	$12,459,079	%53.34	$646.85

2.	In addition, we can also see that schools with the higher student population scores significantly lower in math compares to reading, which brings down the overall passing rate. However, it is too early to question the effectiveness of our math programs for large schools, there could be hidden factors such as students demographics and backgrounds or even discrepancies in data that might result the % passing math to be low.
